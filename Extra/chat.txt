Random story based game

met history en de ai die bepaalt wat er gebeurd

🎯 Goal:
Build a text-based adventure game where the AI acts as the Game Master and responds creatively to your input. The story evolves based on your choices.

🧱 1. Structure the Interface
A scrollable chat window for the game log

A single-line input for the player’s actions

A "Send" button

A "Restart" button

🧠 2. Design the Game Loop
Each turn:

Get player input

Add it to a running history string

Combine history with a prompt template that tells the AI it’s a game master

Send it to the LLM (with pipe(...))

Display the result

Append both player input and AI response to the visible game log

🧰 3. Define the Prompt Template
Design a consistent structure:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are a game master guiding the player through a fantasy adventure.

History:
Player: open the door  
Game Master: The door creaks open to reveal a dark corridor.  

Player: walk into the corridor  
Game Master:
Append player input and AI response after each turn to maintain context

🔁 4. Store State
Use a history variable (a string or array of {role: "user"/"ai", message} objects)

Reset it when clicking "Restart"

Display the full back-and-forth in the chat box

🎨 5. Polish the UX
Add loading feedback while waiting for AI

Autoscroll to the bottom after each message

Disable the input while the AI is "thinking"

Maybe add sound effects or background music 🎵

🚀 6. Stretch Goals
Theme selector: Fantasy, Sci-fi, Post-apocalyptic, etc.

Simple inventory system (just tracked in history)

Let the player name their character

Save/load game state using localStorage

💭 7. Prompt Engineering Experiments
Once it's working, tweak the behavior by:

Adjusting the initial system prompt (make it silly, dark, mysterious)

Adding constraints ("Only describe events in haiku")

Giving it personality ("You're a sarcastic Dungeon Master")
